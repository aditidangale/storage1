- The data generated per day is 328.77 million terabytes is equall to 120 zettabytes.
- how much data is created every day per person ?
       with around 5.35 billion internet users worldwide , each person can potentially generated 
       approximately 15.87TB of day daily.

These terms are often used by data storage providers to describe their tiered storage plans. 
The terms may have originated from how data was historically stored, with hot data being stored 
close to the heat of spinning drives and CPUs, and cold data being stored on drives or tape away 
from the warmer data center. 

-  hot data
       hot data is data that is frequently accessed or in high demand.
       Hot data is typically stored on faster storage, such as solid state disks.
       As hot data is accessed less frequently, it can be dynamically moved to slower storage.

-  cold data 
       cold data is data that is rarely accessed.
       cold data is stored on slower, less expensive storage, such as hard drives, optical discs,
       tapes, or cloud storage.

Information stored in data warehouses is often used for analytics. Hot archival makes this
       information available instantly. 
Cold Storage: Cold archival is the long-term archival of data, and it is not intended to be
       accessed often. This type of archival is typically 
used for long-term backups and archiving purposes.

Speed is the most important factor to consider when evaluating archival options. 
    Every company is different, so there is no right answer. Ideally,
all three should be used, it’s just a matter of defining how much of which. Below are additional
   factors to consider:

Hot Storage: Hot archival is the short-term or working memory, and it contains active files that 
are still being used. Hot data archival is best used when an application requires fast access to 
the data—for example, online transaction processing (OLTP). An OLTP system must process 
transactions in real time. Hot archival makes this possible. Another example is a data warehouse. 
These data stores must process large queries. Information stored in data warehouses is often used 
for analytics. Hot archival makes this information available instantly.

Cold Storage: Cold archival is the long-term archival of data, and it is not intended to be 
accessed often. This type of archival is typically used for long-term backups and archiving 
purposes. 

The most common use case for cold data archival is to provide secondary or backup copies of 
hot (or warm) data. Cold archival is also ideal for organizations with strict compliance needs. 
Some companies may benefit from using cold archival for offsite backups. 
Additional scenarios include:

Offline backups of data from a live application or operating system. 
Archive storage for data that has been migrated to an online archiving solution but needs to be 
retrieved offline occasionally (e.g., regulatory compliance). 
Data retention policies where an organization must retain all records for a given amount of time 
before they can be deleted. 
Legal or forensic information.
Warm Storage: Warm archival is a mix between cold and hot archival because it can be used as 
either one depending on your needs and preferences at any given time. This type of archival
provides a good compromise between the two options that can be useful in many situations.

Primary Memory
   Primary storage or memory is also known as the main memory, which is the part of the computer 
   that stores current data, programs, and instructions. Primary storage is stored in the 
   motherboard which results in the data from and to primary storage can be read and written at 
   a very good pace.

What is Primary Memory
Primary memory is a segment of computer memory that can be accessed directly by the processor. 
In a hierarchy of memory, primary memory has access time less than secondary memory and greater 
than cache memory. Generally, primary memory has a storage capacity lesser than secondary memory 
and greater than cache memory.

Need of primary memory
In order to enhance the efficiency of the system, memory is organized in such a way that access 
time for the ready process is minimized. The following approach is followed to minimize access 
time for the ready process.

All programs, files, and data are stored in secondary storage that is larger and hence has 
greater access time.
Secondary memory can not be accessed directly by a CPU or processor.
In order, to execute any process operating system loads the process in primary memory which is 
smaller and can be accessed directly by the CPU.
Since only those processes are loaded in primary memory which is ready to be executed, the CPU 
can access those processes efficiently and this optimizes the performance of the system.

Primary Memory Example
    Primary Memory examples are RAM, ROM, cache, PROM, EPROM, registers, etc.

Classification of Primary Memory
    Primary memory can be broadly classified into two parts:

Read-Only Memory (ROM)
Random Access Memory (RAM)

Read-Only Memory
Any data which need not be altered are stored in ROM. ROM includes those programs which run on 
booting of the system (known as a bootstrap program that initializes OS) along with data like 
algorithm required by OS. Anything stored in ROM cannot be altered or changed.

Types of ROM:
ROM can be broadly classified into 4 types based on their behavior:

MROM: Masked ROM is hardwired and pre-programmed ROM. Any content that is once written cannot 
be altered anyhow.

PROM: Programmable ROM can be modified once by the user. The user buys a blank PROM and writes 
the desired content but once written content cannot be altered.

EPROM: Erasable and Programmable ROM Content can be changed by erasing the initial content which
can be done by exposing EPROM to UV radiation. This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates
the charge on ROM and content can be rewritten on it.

EEPROM: Electrically Erasable and Programmable ROM Content can be changed by erasing the initial
content which could be easily erased electrically. However, one byte can be erased at a time 
instead of deleting in one go. Hence, reprogramming of EEPROM is a slow process.

Random Access Memory
Any process in the system which needs to be executed is loaded in RAM which is processed by the 
CPU as per Instructions in the program. Like if we click on applications like Browser, firstly 
browser code will be loaded by the Operating system into the RAM after which the CPU will 
execute and open up the Browser.

Types of RAM:
RAM can be broadly classified into SRAM (Static RAM) and DRAM (Dynamic RAM) based on their 
behavior:

DRAM: Dynamic RAM or DRAM needs to periodically refresh in a few milliseconds to retain data. 
DRAM is made up of capacitors and transistors and electric charge leaks from capacitors and DRAM 
needs to be charged periodically. DRAM is widely used in home PCs and servers as it is cheaper
than SRAM.

SRAM: Static RAM or SRAM keeps the data as long as power is supplied to the system. 
SRAM uses Sequential circuits like a flip-flop to store a bit and hence need not be periodically
refreshed. SRAM is expensive and hence only used where speed is the utmost priority.

Primary Memory is volatile in nature.

Content of primary memory may or may not vanish when power is lost depending on if it is 
stored in RAM or ROM. 

The content of ROM is non-volatile in nature, they are stored even when power is lost.
The content of RAM is volatile in nature, it vanishes when power is lost.

When cache memory comes into existence?
Data in primary memory can be accessed faster than secondary memory but still, access times of 
primary memory are generally in a few microseconds, whereas the CPU is capable of performing 
operations in nanoseconds. Due to the time lag between accessing data and acting on data 
performance of the system decreases as the CPU is not utilized properly, it may remain idle for 
some time. In order to minimize this time gap new segment of memory is Introduced known as 
Cache Memory.


Secondary storage, also known as auxiliary storage or secondary memory, is a non-volatile memory 
medium that stores data that is not frequently accessed. It's a backup solution that can be used
to store data that needs to be more reliable or have enough backup capacity than primary storage
devices like internal hard drives and flash drives. Secondary storage devices are characterized
by high capacity and low cost, but other factors like speed, reliability, and portability may 
also be important.


Here are some examples of secondary storage devices:
Hard disk
Also known as fixed storage or fixed disc drives, hard disks are internal media devices that 
store data in a computer system.

Cloud storage
Can be used for archiving data, which can be more economical than storing data locally on a server.

Optical memory
A relatively new secondary storage medium that can store large amounts of data in limited space.

Floppy disk
A type of disk storage made of a thin and flexible magnetic storage medium that's used for backup 
purposes.

Other factors to consider with secondary storage include longevity and long-term accessibility. 
For example, data stored on magnetic tapes from previous decades may be practically unusable today.

Secondary storage, sometimes called auxiliary storage, is non-volatile and is used to store data 
and programs for later retrieval. There are many kinds of secondary storage, each with advantages
and disadvantages. Most storage devices use either magnetic or optical storage media
